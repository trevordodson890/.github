Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a passionate software developer with over 8 years of experience in building web and mobile applications. My primary expertise lies in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python, and I am an enthusiastic advocate for clean code and robust architectures.

I specialize in full-stack development, working extensively with frameworks such as React, Node.js, and Django. My backend experience is complemented by my knowledge of various databases, including PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and MySQL. I love exploring new technologies and have a keen interest in DevOps practices, particularly with Docker and Kubernetes.

Throughout my career, I have embraced Agile methodologies, which allows me to work collaboratively with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality products. I believe in continuous learning and frequently engage with the developer community through contributions to open-source projects and attending tech meetups.

In addition to coding, I enjoy mentoring junior developers and sharing knowledge about best practices and emerging trends in software development. My projects often reflect my interests in building user-centric applications and solving real-world problems with technology.
